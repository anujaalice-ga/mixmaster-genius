# AI-Powered Cement Mix Advisor

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Cement Mix Advisor** is a practical, human-centric application that streamlines cement mix design. It leverages **Generative AI** to propose optimized mixes based on user-specified targets (strength, durability, shrinkage, CO₂ footprint) and an **AI agent layer** to evaluate feasibility, highlight trade-offs, and prevent redundant testing. A **human-in-the-loop** ensures engineers retain control, reviewing and approving final mixes before lab testing or production.

This tool transforms a slow, trial-and-error workflow into a fast, actionable, and environmentally conscious process for lab engineers and plant operators.

## Key Features

- **AI Mix Generation:** Produces multiple candidate cement mixes based on target specifications.
- **Feasibility Checks:** Ensures mixes comply with water/cement ratio limits, total binder constraints, and other basic rules.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Engineers review, tweak, and approve AI-generated mixes.
- **Interactive UI:** Card-based presentation with sliders and graphs to visualize mix properties.
- **Lab Testing Recommendations:** AI agent suggests which mixes to send for lab validation.
- **Results Tracking & Recall:** Store and recall past mixes and lab results for future reference.
- **Production Request Generation:** Automatically generates raw material requests for approved mixes.
- **GenAI Lab Manual:** Explains chemical and mix effects in plain language for operator guidance.

## Workflow

1. Engineer enters target specifications (strength, shrinkage, CO₂, etc.).
2. Generative AI produces multiple candidate mixes.
3. AI agent evaluates feasibility, checks duplicates, and highlights trade-offs.
4. Engineer reviews suggestions, makes
